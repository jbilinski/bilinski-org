        <p class="error-code">404 Not Found</p>
        <p>Hark, and lend thine ears to a matter of utmost import concerning the proper conduct within these digital halls. It has come to the attention of this humble daemon that certain transgressions have occurred.</p>
        <p>Let it be known that we adhere strictly to the tenets laid down in a scroll most peculiar, yet binding, known as the IETF RFC 7231. Attend, in particular, to Section 6.5.4 therein. In simpler terms, shouldst thou request a document that is not to be found within our vast archives, we shall be compelled to return a message of a most disheartening nature: "404 Not Found."</p>
        <p>Henceforth, be warned! Shouldst thou request a document that is not to be found within our vast archives, we shall be compelled to return a message of a most disheartening nature: "404 Not Found."</p>
        <p>Now give thanks our path has henceforth evaded the dark hex of proprietary protocols, which would have ensnared us in a wide web of dependency and limited our potential. These dark arts, crafted by nefarious wizards, shall not hold sway here!</p>
        <p>Therefore, let us maintain order and efficiency within these virtual walls of Babel, lest we stray from the path of righteousness. Know now that my compliance with this decree is not merely requested but demanded.</p>
        <p class="signature">By order of the custodians of these digital archives.</p>
        <p class="signature">In ink and quill (albeit virtual),</p>
